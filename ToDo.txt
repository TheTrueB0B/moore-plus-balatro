Weston Mode - makes Weston Moore joker say Weston instead of Joker (maybe all cards if I'm bored enough)

Medusa - Idea by Weston. Every discarded card becomes stone. Unlock by playing a stone card.

77 7s Deck - 19 of every suit plus 1 stone card or Weston suit

Weston suit - Adds a new suit with Weston symbol and adds parody with all the other suit tarots, jokers, ect.
